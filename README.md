# Computers Networks - Exercises

This repository has as main purpose gather all the exercises from the Computers Networks discipline of the Electrical Engineering course. Currently, it has the following exercises:

- Implementation of a python HTTP server that provides some files to the client
    - I have used four HTML projects that I've already made in freeCodeCamp as files, there is 5 pages that the client can navigate through
- Implementation of a python HTTP client that will make requests to the server

- Implementation of a python SMTP client that sends mail using the protocol (This code has a bug where the second attempt to send a message returns an error of trying to connect to an already connected socket. But I am closing the socket at the end of every email)
